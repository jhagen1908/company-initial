# company-initial

First error - communications link failure with mysql (run locally)
Configured and started mysql, added user as in dependency file, added schema company-db, granted access to user

app started!  probably next need to find sample data and get it loaded.

Found the SampleData class.  Not sure why it's not loading; based on my limited Spring knowledge it should run via CommandLineRunner.
